SIMULATION OF BASIC TEST SIGNALS

1. Unit Impulse Signal:
• A signal that is zero everywhere except at one point, typically at t=0 where its value is 1.
• Mathematically δ(t) ={∞; 𝒕 = 𝟎&𝟎; 𝒕 ≠ 𝟎}

2. Unit Step Signal:
• A signal that is zero for all negative time values and one for positive time values.
• Mathematically u(t) ={𝟏; 𝒕 ≥ 𝟎&𝟎; 𝒕 < 𝟎}

3. Ramp Signal:
• A signal that increases linearly with time.
• Mathematically r(t) ={ 𝒕; 𝒕 ≥ 𝟎&𝟎; 𝒕 < 𝟎}

4. Sine Signal:
• A continuous periodic signal. It oscillates smoothly between -1 and 1.
• Mathematically: y(t)=Asin(2πft)

5. Cosine Signal:
• A continuous periodic signal like the sine wave but phase-shifted by π\2.
• Mathematically: y(t)=Acos(2πft)

6. Square wave-bipolar:
• A pulse signal that alternates between positive and negative values, usually rectangular in 
shape. It switches between two constant levels (e.g., -1 and 1) for a defined duration.
• Mathematically p(t) = A for |t| ≤ τ/2, p(t) = 0 otherwise

7. Square wave-unipolar:
• A pulse signal that alternates between zero and a positive value. It remains at zero for a specified 
duration and then jumps to a positive constant level (e.g., 0 and 1).
• Mathematically p(t) = A for |t| ≤ τ/2, p(t) = 0 otherwise (assuming A is positive)

8. Exponential Signal:
• A signal that increases or decreases exponentially with time. The rate of growth or decay is 
determined by the constant a.
• Mathematically: e^(at)
